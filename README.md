[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jage/elk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jage/elk)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jage/elk/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jage/elk)

Ruby client for 46elks "Voice, SMS & MMS" service. http://46elks.com/
At the moment the API only supports sending SMS messages.

## Requirements

* Modern Ruby: >= 1.9
* API account at 46elks.com

## Install

Install via RubyGems

    gem install elk

## Source and development

The source for Elk is available on Github:

    https://github.com/jage/elk

Elk uses rspec and webmock for testing, do a `bundle install` for all the development requirements.

Test specs with:

    bundle exec rake spec

## Usage

elk can be used to allocate phone numbers, manage the numbers and send/receive messages through these numbers.

### Authentication and configuration

First thing when using elk is to set the authentication parameters

```Ruby
require "elk"

Elk.configure do |config|
  config.username = "USERNAME"
  config.password = "PASSWORD"
end
```

It is possible to avoid the singleton configuration:

```Ruby
require "elk"

client = Elk::Client.new
client.configure do |config|
  config.username = "USERNAME"
  config.password = "PASSWORD"
end

# Then pass client to the class methods
numbers = Elk::Number.all(client: client)
# => [#<Elk::Number ...>, #<Elk::Number ...>]


Elk::SMS.send(client: client, from: "MyService", to: "+46704508449", message: "Your order #171 has now been sent!")
# => #<Elk::SMS:0x0000010179d7e8 @client=... @from="MyService", @to="+46704508449", @message="Your order #171 has now been sent!", @message_id="sdc39a7926d37159b6985283e32f43251", @created_at=2011-07-17 16:21:13 +0200, @loaded_at=2011-07-17 16:21:13 +0200>
```

### Numbers

To be able to send and recieve messages, a number is needed. Several numbers can be allocated.

```Ruby
number = Elk::Number.allocate(sms_url: "http://myservice.se/callback/newsms.php", country: "se")
# => #<Elk::Number:0x0000010282aa70 @country="se", @sms_url="http://myservice.se/callback/newsms.php", @status="yes", @number_id="n03e7db70cc06c1ff85e09a2b3f86dd62", @number="+46766861034", @capabilities=[:sms], @loaded_at=2011-07-17 15:23:55 +0200>
```

Get all numbers

```Ruby
numbers = Elk::Number.all
# => [#<Elk::Number ...>, #<Elk::Number ...>]
```

Change number settings

```Ruby
number.sms_url = "http://myservice.se/callback/newsms.php"
number.save
# => true
```

Deallocate a number.
Beware that there is no way to get your number back once it has been deallocated!

```Ruby
number.deallocate!
# => true
number.status
# => :deallocated
```

### SMS

Send SMS. Messages can be sent from one of the allocated numbers or an arbitrary alphanumeric string of at most 11 characters.

```Ruby
Elk::SMS.send(from: "MyService", to: "+46704508449", message: "Your order #171 has now been sent!")
# => #<Elk::SMS:0x0000010179d7e8 @from="MyService", @to="+46704508449", @message="Your order #171 has now been sent!", @message_id="sdc39a7926d37159b6985283e32f43251", @created_at=2011-07-17 16:21:13 +0200, @loaded_at=2011-07-17 16:21:13 +0200>
```

Receiving SMS does not require Elk, but should be of interest anyway.
Example with Sinatra:

```Ruby
post "/receive" do
  if request.params["message"] == "Hello"
    # Sends a return SMS with message "world!"
    "world!"
  end
end
```

SMS history

```Ruby
Elk::SMS.all
# => [#<Elk::SMS ...>, #<Elk::SMS ...>, <Elk::SMS ...>]
```
